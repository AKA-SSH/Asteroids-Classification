        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Model training is a crucial step in the development of machine learning models. During this phase, the model learns from the input data to make predictions or classifications on new data.</p>
        <h2>Steps in Model Training</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Data Preprocessing: Prepare the data for training by cleaning, transforming, and splitting it into training and validation sets.</li>
            <li>Choose a Model: Select the appropriate machine learning algorithm or model architecture based on the problem at hand and the nature of the data.</li>
            <li>Training the Model: Feed the training data into the chosen model and adjust its parameters to minimize errors and improve performance.</li>
            <li>Evaluation: Assess the trained model's performance using validation data and metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score.</li>
            <li>Optimization: Fine-tune the model by adjusting hyperparameters, trying different algorithms, or using techniques like regularization to improve performance further.</li>
            <li>Deployment: Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it for use in real-world applications.</li>
        </ol>
